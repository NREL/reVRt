   barrier layer
      Weighted raster dataset that stores cells where routing is blocked
      or strongly penalized. reVRt writes the combined barriers to the
      ``transmission_barrier`` dataset inside the :term:`routing file`.

   barrier multiplier
      Scalar applied to raw barrier rasters before they are merged with
      friction values. The multiplier is configured through
      :class:`~revrt.models.cost_layers.MergeFrictionBarriers` and
      controls how restrictive obstacles become in the combined layer.

   cell size
      The ground distance represented by one raster pixel, usually
      expressed in meters. Cell size is derived from the affine
      transform stored with each dataset and is used when converting
      per-mile cost inputs to per-cell values.

   cost layer
      Individual raster derived from source GeoTIFFs, vector data, or
      global values that contributes to the total routing cost surface.
      Cost layers are configured with
      :class:`~revrt.models.cost_layers.LayerBuildConfig` entries.

   cost per mile
      Units used by some source datasets where costs are provided in
      currency per mile. When ``values_are_costs_per_mile`` is enabled
      during layer creation, reVRt scales those values by the
      :term:`cell size` to obtain a per-cell cost.

   cost surface
      Aggregate raster the routing engine traverses to minimize total
      cost between endpoints. It combines friction layers, adjusted
      barrier penalties, and any scenario-specific modifiers.

   Dask
      Parallel computing library that powers reVRt's chunked raster
      processing. Dask arrays allow large GeoTIFFs to be processed in
      memory-efficient blocks and executed across multiple cores.

   dry mask
      Boolean mask representing onshore cells without landfall pixels.
      ``dry`` is one of the supported :term:`extent` values used when
      scoping where a cost rule applies.

   extent
      Named region identifier that limits where a layer build rule
      applies. Valid values are ``all``, ``wet``, ``wet+``, ``landfall``,
      ``dry+``, and ``dry`` as defined in
      :mod:`revrt.models.cost_layers`. Each extent corresponds to one of
      the masks generated by :class:`~revrt.costs.masks.Masks`.

   forced inclusion
      GeoTIFF layer that guarantees certain cells remain traversable.
      Any positive values in a forced inclusion raster cause the final
      combined cost to be set to zero for the same cells, ensuring a
      route can pass through critical locations.

   friction layer
      Raster expressing the incremental cost required to traverse each
      cell. Friction layers capture factors such as terrain slope,
      land-use multipliers, and water crossings before barrier penalties
      are applied.

   GeoTIFF
      Open geospatial raster format based on the TIFF specification that
      embeds projection metadata. reVRt relies on GeoTIFF files as the
      canonical interchange format for intermediate layers and masks.

   landfall mask
      Boolean mask identifying shoreline cells at the interface between
      onshore and offshore extents. Landfall pixels can be included with
      either :term:`wet mask` or :term:`dry mask` variants depending on
      the requested :term:`extent`.

   LayeredFile
      HDF5-based container that stores aligned rasters, coordinates, and
      metadata used in routing workflows. ``LayeredFile`` instances back
      the data written to the :term:`routing file` and expose helper
      methods for reading and writing layers consistently.

   least-cost path
      Graph search procedure that computes the minimum-cost connection
      between a source and destination over the :term:`cost surface`.
      reVRt uses least-cost-path solvers inside the Rust routing core.

   masks
      Collection of boolean rasters generated by
      :class:`~revrt.costs.masks.Masks` to distinguish wet, dry, and
      landfall regions. Masks are referenced when applying extent
      filters, building barriers, and reporting statistics.

   Pixi
      Cross-platform package and environment manager used to provision
      Python, Rust, and system dependencies for development, testing,
      and documentation tasks. Project commands such as ``pixi run``
      ensure reproducible execution environments.

   point of interconnection
      Electrical grid location where a project, plant, or study point
      connects to existing transmission infrastructure. Points of
      interconnection often serve as endpoints for routing scenarios.

   PyO3
      Rust library that enables bi-directional interoperability with
      Python. reVRt's high-performance routing algorithms are compiled
      as a PyO3 extension module and imported into Python as
      ``revrt._rust``.

   reV
      NLR's reV tool that models generation profiles and supply curves
      for various generation types. reVRt complements reV by adding
      transmission routing capabilities that feed downstream analyses.

   reVRt
      The reV Routing toolkit that prepares cost surfaces, runs routing
      simulations, and exports supporting analytics for transmission
      planning studies.

   routing file
      HDF5 file produced by the cost preparation pipeline that stores
      coordinate grids, friction and barrier layers, metadata, and any
      derived statistics. The routing file is accessed through the
      :class:`~revrt.utilities.handlers.LayeredFile` API.

   transmission corridor
      Buffered polygon around a candidate route used for downstream
      analytics such as land characterization and permitting review.

   wet mask
      Boolean mask representing offshore cells without landfall pixels.
      ``wet`` and ``wet+`` extents rely on the wet mask variants when
      filtering routing layers.

   Zarr
      Chunked, cloud-friendly array storage format used by reVRt for
      some example inputs and regression fixtures. Zarr data enables
      lazy, parallel access patterns similar to Dask-backed rasters.
