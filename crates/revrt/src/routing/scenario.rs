//! A scenario for routing
//!
//! A `Scenario` encapsulates the cost surface and everything required to
//! define that, such as the input features and the cost function.
//!
//! A typical scenario uses a cost function that weights several
//! features to determine the cost per grid point.
//!
//! Given the relatively high resolution and the desire on routing long
//! distances, the data involved can be relatively large. A major
//! accomplishment of this crate is in this module, by working in chunks
//! with asynchronous I/O we keep the memory footprint low while
//! sustaining high performance as possible.
