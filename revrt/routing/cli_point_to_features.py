    """Create a route table mapping points to nearest features

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost_fpath : path-like
        Path to cost surface input file. This file will be used to
        define the CRS and transform for mapping points. If the
        `resolution` input is not ``None``, the cost surface grid shape
        will also be used to generate points.
    features_fpath : path-like
        Path to vector file containing features to map points to.
    out_dir : path-like
        Directory where routing outputs should be written.
    points_fpath : path-like, optional
        Path to csv file defining the start points to map to features.
        This input must contain "latitude" and "longitude" columns,
        which define the location of each starting point. This input may
        also have a radius column that defines a unique radius per
        point (see the `radius` input for details). At least one of
        `points_fpath` or `resolution` must be provided.
        By default, ``None``.
    resolution : int, optional
        reV supply curve point resolution used to generate the supply
        curve point grid. It is assumed that the `cost_fpath` input
        is of the same shape and resolution as the exclusion grid used
        to generate the supply curve points. If `points_fpath` is
        provided, this input is ignored. At least one of `points_fpath`
        or `resolution` must be provided. By default, ``None``.
    regions_fpath : path-like, optional
        Optional path to file containing region boundaries that should
        be used to clip features. Specifically, points will only be
        mapped to features within their boundary. This can be used to
        limit connections by geography (i.e. within a state or county).
        At least one of `regions_fpath` or `radius` must be provided.
        By default, ``None``.
    radius : str or float, optional
        Distance (in cost CRS units) used to limit radial connection
        length (i.e. a radius input of ``25_000`` in a "meter" CRS will
        limit all connections for the point to be within a circle of
        25 km radius). If this input is a string, it should be the
        column name in the input points that contains a unique radius
        value per point. This input can be combined with the
        `regions_fpath` input (to prevent connections from crossing
        state boundaries, for example). At least one of `regions_fpath`
        or `radius` must be provided. By default, ``None``.
    expand_radius : bool, default=True
        Option to expand the `radius` value for each point until at
        least one feature is found to connect to. This input has no
        effect if `radius` is ``None``. By default, ``True``.
    feature_out_fp : str, default="mapped_features.gpkg"
        Name of output file for mapped (and potentially clipped)
        features. This output fil will contain an identifier column that
        can be linked back to the output route table. By default,
        ``"mapped_features.gpkg"``.
    route_table_out_fp : str, default="route_table.csv"
        Name of route table output file. This file will contain a start
        row and column index (into the cost raster) as well as a feature
        ID that maps into the `feature_out_fp` to route to.
        By default, ``"route_table.csv"``.
    region_identifier_column : str, default="rid"
        Column in the `regions_fpath` data used to uniquely identify
        each region. If a column name is given that does not exist in
        the data, it will created using the feature index as the ID.
        By default, ``"rid"``.
    feature_identifier_column : str, default="end_feat_id"
        Column name in the `feature_out_fp` and `route_table_out_fp`
        used to identify which features map to which points.
        By default, ``"end_feat_id"``.
    batch_size : int, default=500
        Number of features to process before writing to output feature
        file. This can be used to tune the tradeoff between performance
        and memory requirements. By default, ``500``.

    list of path-like
        Path to route table output file and mapped feature output file.
