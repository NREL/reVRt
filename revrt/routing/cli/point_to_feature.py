    r"""Run least-cost path routing for points mapped to features

    Given a table that defines each route as a start point (via latitude
    and longitude input or preferably a row/column index into the data)
    and a feature ID representing the feature to connect to, compute the
    least-cost paths (LCPs) for each route using the cost layers defined
    in the `cost_layers` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost_fpath : path-like
        Path to layered Zarr file containing cost and other required
        routing layers.
    route_table : path-like
        Path to CSV file defining the start points and end features of
        all routes. Must have the following columns:

            - "start_lat": Stating point latitude (can alternatively use
              "start_col" to define the start point column index in the
              cost raster).
            - "start_lon": Stating point longitude (can alternatively
              use "start_row" to define the start point row index in the
              cost raster).
            - `feature_identifier_column`: ID of the feature that should
              be mapped to. This ID should match at least one of the
              feature IDs in the `features_fpath` input; otherwise, no
              route will be computed for that point.

    features_fpath : path-like
        Path to vector file containing features to map points to. This
        file must have a column matching the `feature_identifier_column`
        parameter that maps each feature back to the starting points
        defined in the `route_table`.
    cost_layers : list
        List of dictionaries defining the layers that are summed to
        determine total costs raster used for routing. Each layer is
        pre-processed before summation according to the user input.
        Each dict in the list should have the following keys:

            - "layer_name": (REQUIRED) Name of layer in layered file
              containing cost data.
            - "multiplier_layer": (OPTIONAL) Name of layer in layered
              file containing spatially explicit multiplier values to
              apply to this cost layer before summing it with the
              others. Default is ``None``.
            - "multiplier_scalar": (OPTIONAL) Scalar value to multiply
              this layer by before summing it with the others. Default
              is ``1``.
            - "is_invariant": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating whether
              this layer is length invariant (i.e. should NOT be
              multiplied by path length; values should be $). Default is
              ``False``.
            - "include_in_final_cost": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag
              indicating whether this layer should contribute to the
              final cost output for each route in the LCP table.
              Default is ``True``.
            - "include_in_report": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the costs and distances for this layer should be
              output in the final LCP table. Default is ``True``.
            - "apply_row_mult": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the right-of-way width multiplier should be
              applied for this layer. If ``True``, then the transmission
              config should have a "row_width" dictionary that maps
              voltages to right-of-way width multipliers. Also, the
              routing table input should have a "voltage" entry for
              every route. Every "voltage" value in the routing table
              must be given in the "row_width" dictionary in the
              transmission config, otherwise an error will be thrown.
              Default is ``False``.
            - "apply_polarity_mult": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the polarity multiplier should be applied for this
              layer. If ``True``, then the transmission config should
              have a "voltage_polarity_mult" dictionary that maps
              voltages to a new dictionary, the latter mapping
              polarities to multipliers. For example, a valid
              "voltage_polarity_mult" dictionary might be
              ``{"138": {"ac": 1.15, "dc": 2}}``.
              In addition, the routing table input should have a
              "voltage" **and** a "polarity" entry for every route.
              Every "voltage" + "polarity" combination in the routing
              table must be given in the "voltage_polarity_mult"
              dictionary in the transmission config, otherwise an error
              will be thrown.

              .. IMPORTANT::
                 The multiplier in this config is assumed to be in units
                 of "million $ per mile" and will be converted to
                 "$ per pixel" before being applied to the layer!

              Default is ``False``.

        The summed layers define the cost routing surface, which
        determines the cost output for each route. Specifically, the
        cost at each pixel is multiplied by the length that the route
        takes through the pixel, and all of these values are summed for
        each route to determine the final cost.

        .. IMPORTANT::
           If a pixel has a final cost of :math:`\leq 0`, it is treated
           as a barrier (i.e. no paths can ever cross this pixel).

    out_dir : path-like
        Directory where routing outputs should be written.
    job_name : str
        Label used to name the generated output file.
    friction_layers : list, optional
        Layers to be multiplied onto the aggregated cost layer to
        influence routing but NOT be reported in final cost
        (i.e. friction, barriers, etc.). These layers are first
        aggregated, and then the aggregated friction layer is applied
        to the aggregated cost. The cost at each pixel is therefore
        computed as:

        .. math::

            C = (\sum_{i} c_i) * (1 + \sum_{j} f_j)

        where :math:`C` is the final cost at each pixel, :math:`c_i` are
        the individual cost layers, and :math:`f_j` are the individual
        friction layers.

        .. NOTE:: :math:`\sum_{j} f_j` is always clamped to be
           :math:`\gt -1` to prevent zero or negative routing costs.
           In other words, :math:`(1 + \sum_{j} f_j) > 0` always holds.
           This means friction can scale costs to/away from zero but
           never cause the sign of the cost layer to flip (even if
           friction values themselves are negative). This means all
           "barrier" pixels (i.e. cost value :math:`\leq 0`) will remain
           barriers after friction is applied.

        Each item in this list should be a dictionary containing the
        following keys:

            - "multiplier_layer" or "mask": (REQUIRED) Name of layer in
              layered file containing the spatial friction multipliers
              or mask that will be turned into the friction multipliers
              by applying the `multiplier_scalar`.
            - "multiplier_scalar": (OPTIONAL) Scalar value to multiply
              the spatial friction layer by before using it as a
              multiplier on the aggregated costs. Default is ``1``.
            - "include_in_report": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the routing and distances for this layer should be
              output in the final LCP table. Default is ``False``.
            - "apply_row_mult": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the right-of-way width multiplier should be
              applied for this layer. If ``True``, then the transmission
              config should have a "row_width" dictionary that maps
              voltages to right-of-way width multipliers. Also, the
              routing table input should have a "voltage" entry for
              every route. Every "voltage" value in the routing table
              must be given in the "row_width" dictionary in the
              transmission config, otherwise an error will be thrown.
              Default is ``False``.
            - "apply_polarity_mult": (OPTIONAL) Boolean flag indicating
              whether the polarity multiplier should be applied for this
              layer. If ``True``, then the transmission config should
              have a "voltage_polarity_mult" dictionary that maps
              voltages to a new dictionary, the latter mapping
              polarities to multipliers. For example, a valid
              "voltage_polarity_mult" dictionary might be
              ``{"138": {"ac": 1.15, "dc": 2}}``.
              In addition, the routing table input should have a
              "voltage" **and** a "polarity" entry for every route.
              Every "voltage" + "polarity" combination in the routing
              table must be given in the "voltage_polarity_mult"
              dictionary in the transmission config, otherwise an error
              will be thrown.

              .. IMPORTANT::
                 The multiplier in this config is assumed to be in units
                 of "million $ per mile" and will be converted to
                 "$ per pixel" before being applied to the layer!

              Default is ``False``.

        By default, ``None``.
    tracked_layers : dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping layer names to strings, where the strings are
        dask aggregation methods (similar to what numpy has) that
        should be applied to the layer along the LCP to be included as a
        characterization column in the output. By default, ``None``.
    cost_multiplier_layer : str, optional
        Name of the spatial multiplier layer applied to final costs.
        By default, ``None``.
    cost_multiplier_scalar : int, default=1
        Scalar multiplier applied to the final cost surface.
        By default, ``1``.
    transmission_config : path-like or dict, optional
        Dictionary of transmission cost configuration values, or
        path to JSON/JSON5 file containing this dictionary. The
        dictionary should have a subset of the following keys:

            - base_line_costs
            - iso_lookup
            - iso_multipliers
            - land_use_classes
            - new_substation_costs
            - power_classes
            - power_to_voltage
            - transformer_costs
            - upgrade_substation_costs
            - voltage_polarity_mult
            - row_width

        Each of these keys should point to another dictionary or
        path to JSON/JSON5 file containing a dictionary of
        configurations for each section. For the expected contents
        of each dictionary, see the default config. If ``None``,
        values from the default config are used.
        By default, ``None``.
    save_paths : bool, default=False
        Save outputs as a GeoPackage with path geometries when ``True``.
        Defaults to ``False``.
    ignore_invalid_costs : bool, optional
        Optional flag to treat any cost values <= 0 as impassable
        (i.e. no paths can ever cross this). If ``False``, cost values
        of <= 0 are set to a large value to simulate a strong but
        permeable "quasi-barrier". By default, ``False``.
    feature_identifier_column : str, default="end_feat_id"
        Column in the `features_fpath` data used to uniquely identify
        each feature. This column is also expected to be in the
        `route_table` input to map points to features. If a column name
        is given that does not exist in the data, an error will be
        raised. By default, ``"end_feat_id"``.

    Returns

    str or None
