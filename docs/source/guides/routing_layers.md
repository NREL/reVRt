# Routing Layer Concept Model

``reVRt`` is designed to help you compute an "optimal" route from
point ``A`` to ``B``. To define what we mean by ``optimal``, we
use high-resolution geospatial layers with spatially-distinct
"cost" values. The "cost" values can represent actual dollar costs
or any other quantity that you may wish to study.

The optimal route is always computed through a single layer, but
this layer may be composed of several customizable components.
In the following sections, we break down each of these components
and how you can use the to build out the scenario that you are
interested in studying.
