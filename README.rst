Welcome to reV Routing (reVRt)!
===============================


The reV Routing tool is a computational framework for modeling and optimizing
transmission infrastructure requirements for electrical grid connections. By
employing a spatially-aware least-cost-path methodology, it allows users to
incorporate a wide range of factors including siting constraints, regional
component costs, land composition costs, point-of-interconnection costs, and
network upgrade costs. Additionally, the tool enables advanced follow-on
analyses, such as land characterization for potential transmission line routes,
to support informed decision-making. Although it's designed to integrate
seamlessly with the reV model, the reV Routing tool is versatile and can also
be utilized independently for standalone analyses in transmission planning and
resource assessment scenarios.
