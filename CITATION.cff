  The reV Routing tool is a computational framework for modeling
  and optimizing transmission infrastructure requirements for
  electrical grid connections. By employing a spatially-aware
  least-cost-path methodology, it allows users to incorporate a
  wide range of factors including siting constraints, regional
  component costs, land composition costs, point-of-interconnection
  costs, and network upgrade costs. Additionally, the tool enables
  advanced follow-on analyses, such as land characterization for
  potential transmission line routes, to support informed
  decision-making. Although it's designed to integrate seamlessly
  with the reV model, the reV Routing tool is versatile and
  can also be utilized independently for standalone analyses in
  transmission planning and resource assessment scenarios.
